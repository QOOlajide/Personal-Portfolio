Approved About copy:

“I’m Quamdeen Olajide, a full-stack software engineer focused on building production-ready systems, not toy apps. I specialize in agentic workflows and solving real-world problems through thoughtful, end-to-end engineering.

I’m also a Muslim, and that identity meaningfully shapes how I build. Before I code, I ask: who benefits from this, how can it be used, and is it permissible and beneficial in the long run? That reflection drives both my technical and product decisions.

Some of my work is built specifically for the Muslim community, such as an Eid community platform. Other projects—like my AI customer support agent and terminal-based coding tools—are designed to benefit both Muslims and non-Muslims alike.

Every project I ship is deliberately considered, impact-driven, and built with responsibility in mind. Feel free to explore my projects below, or reach out if you’d like to collaborate or have an inquiry.”
