# Projects Section — Data Schema (Screenshot-Driven)

Source of truth:
- Project card structure must match the first screenshot provided earlier.
- Do NOT add category pills.
- Do NOT invent technologies.
- Tech stacks must be derived from my resume only.

Each project card MUST follow this exact structure (top → bottom):

---

## 1) Thumbnail
- Image at top of card
- Consistent height across all projects
- Rounded corners
- Decorative only (no embedded text required)

---

## 2) Project Title
- Clear, descriptive
- No abbreviations unless widely known
- Example: “CampusMind AI Agent”

---

## 3) Meta Line
- Format: icon + short label
- Example: “Duration: 4.5 months”
- Keep muted and secondary

---

## 4) Description
- 2–4 sentences max
- Must answer:
  - What problem does this solve?
  - Who benefits from it?
- Avoid buzzwords
- Avoid implementation details here

---

## 5) Tech Stack Chips
- Rounded chips, muted styling
- Tech names ONLY from my resume
- Do NOT add tools not listed on the resume

Rules for chips:
- Separate **Languages** and **Frameworks/Tools** logically
- Do NOT label them visually as “Languages” vs “Frameworks”
- Just display chips in one grouped section

Resume-based sorting guidance:
Languages:
- Python
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Java
- SQL
- HTML/CSS
- Bash/Shell Scripting

Frameworks / Tools:
- React
- Next.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Pinecone
- Tailwind CSS
- Docker
- Git
- Vercel
- AWS
- Prometheus
- Figma

Chip constraints:
- Show only the **core stack per project**
- Maximum: ~8 chips per project
- Do NOT dump everything the resume contains

---

## 6) Action Row (Bottom)
Required actions:
- GitHub (icon or text)
- Demo (if deployed)

Layout:
- Left: “View Project →” (or GitHub)
- Right: “Demo” button

Rules:
- If Demo does not exist, hide it (do not show broken links)
- Do NOT make the entire card clickable
- Buttons/links only

---

Tone & intent:
- Production-ready
- Calm
- Intentional
- No gimmicks

This schema applies to ALL projects in V1.
