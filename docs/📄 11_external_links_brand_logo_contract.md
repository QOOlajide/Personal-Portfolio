# External Links + Brand Logo — Contract (match Screenshot #4 intent)

Goal:
- Whenever users see external/contact/social access points, the brand logo should be present and clickable.

Where this applies:
1) Contact section
2) Footer
3) Any “Social icons row” (LinkedIn, GitHub, Medium)
4) Optional: Project card footer actions (only if tasteful)

Brand logo rules:
- Use your circular “Deen Dynamics” logo as a small icon next to social icons
- Must be clickable:
  - Click opens your main portfolio home (top of page) OR your domain root
- Should sit in the same row as social icons (like the last screenshot)
- Maintain spacing and alignment so it feels deliberate

Social icon row rules:
- Include:
  - LinkedIn icon (link to your LinkedIn)
  - GitHub icon (link to your GitHub)
  - Medium icon (link to Medium)
- Place brand logo either:
  - left of icons (acts like “home”)
  - or right of icons (acts like “brand stamp”)
- Hover effects:
  - slow fade / subtle lift
  - no glow, no bounce

Accessibility:
- Every icon has aria-label
- Focus states visible
